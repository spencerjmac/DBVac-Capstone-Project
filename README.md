# DBVac Capstone Project

## üìò Overview
This project was created as part of a capstone for my Business Data Analytics program. It presents a full-scale business case for DBVac, a fictional company evaluating the launch of a new vacuum product. The goal was to identify:
1. The most financially viable product to develop and release.
2. The best internal candidates to lead the product's launch.

The project uses a combination of **SQL**, **Excel modeling (Expected Cost & NPV Analysis)**, and **a Balanced Scorecard framework** to deliver a data-driven recommendation for DBVac‚Äôs executive team.

## üìä Project Components

### 1. Expected Cost & NPV Analysis
- Built an Excel model to estimate expected R&D costs for three potential products (`Fin`, `Snorkel`, and `Facemask`) using probability-weighted scenarios.
- Calculated Net Present Value (NPV) over 5 years at a 10% discount rate for each product.
- **Result**: The `Facemask` product, while having the highest initial R&D cost, yielded the **highest NPV** at $747,105.

### 2. Product Manager Selection (Balanced Scorecard)
- Queried internal employee data using **SQL**.
- Built a **Balanced Scorecard model** in Excel using six criteria:
  - Trustworthiness
  - Experience
  - Popularity
  - Bonus Score (cost control)
  - ‚ÄúDust Factor‚Äù (relationship with CEO)
  - Softball Game Winner (a proxy for competitiveness)
- Normalized scores using **z-scores**, applied weights based on executive input, and selected the two top-scoring managers:
  - **Evan Thompson** and **Everleigh Young**

### 3. Python Integration *(Optional Appendix)*
- Included a Jupyter Notebook that replicates some score calculations and visualization in Python for portfolio demonstration.
